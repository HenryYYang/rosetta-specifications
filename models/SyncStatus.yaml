  SyncStatus is used to provide additional context about an
  implementation's sync status. It is often used to indicate
  that an implementation is healthy when it cannot be queried 
  until some sync phase occurs.
type: object
properties:
  current_index:
    description: |
      CurrentIndex is the index of the last synced block in the
      current stage.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    example: 100 
  target_index:
    description: |
      TargetIndex is the index of the block that the implementation
      is attempting to sync to in the current stage.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    example: 150 
  stage:
    description: |
      Stage is the phase of the sync process.
    type: string
    example: "header sync"

      sycned is a boolean that indicates if an implementation has reached 
      the most recent block.

      If set to true, the caller will assume that the implementation
      is considered healthy and is at the tip of the network.

      This field is particularly useful for quiescent blockchans where
      the most recent block could have been produced at some variable
      time in the past where a traditional time comparison with tip
      may not make sense.
    type: boolean
