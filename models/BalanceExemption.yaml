  BalanceExemption indicates that the balance for a particular account could
  change without a corresponding Operation. This typically occurs with staking
  rewards, vesting balances, and Currencies with a dynamic supply.

  BalanceExemptions should be used sparingly as they may
  introduce significant complexity for integrators that attempt
  to reconcile all account balance changes.

  If your implementation relies on any BalanceExemptions, you MUST implement
  historical balance lookup (the ability to query an account balance at any
  BlockIdentifier).
