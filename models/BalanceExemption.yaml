  BalanceExemption indicates that the balance for a particular account could
  change without a corresponding Operation. This typically occurs with staking
  rewards, vesting accounts, and currencies with a dynamic supply.

  BalanceExemptions should be used extremely conservatively as they may
  introduce significant complexity for integrators.

  If you rely on any BalanceExemptions, you MUST implement historical
  balance lookup.
